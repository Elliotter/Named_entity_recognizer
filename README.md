# Named_entity_recognizer
## WHY CREATING THIS PROJECT
Named-entity-recognizer has been a baisc task in natural language processing(NLP) and there have been lots of algorism proposed to achieve
the state-of-art results.In this project I will employ different methods and try to figure out what is exactly going on in each part of model
(only deep learning model here) or how much each part contributes to the final results. This may help us have a better understand of deep neural 
networks,especially when we have to design our own model without directly products can be referred to.
